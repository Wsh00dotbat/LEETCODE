To solve the problem of finding the largest subset of binary strings such that the total number of 0s is at most m and the total number of 1s is at most n, we can use a dynamic programming approach. This problem is similar to the classic Knapsack problem, where we have to maximize the value without exceeding the weight capacity.

Approach:
Count the number of 0s and 1s in each string: For each string in strs, count the number of 0s and 1s.

Dynamic Programming Table: Use a 2D DP table dp[i][j] where i represents the number of 0s and j represents the number of 1s. The value dp[i][j] will store the maximum number of strings that can be included without exceeding i 0s and j 1s.

Filling the DP Table: For each string, update the DP table by considering whether to include the current string or not. If including the string does not exceed the limits of m 0s and n 1s, update the DP table accordingly.

Result: The value dp[m][n] will give the size of the largest subset.

Implementation in C++:
cpp
Copy
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxForm(vector<string>& strs, int m, int n) {
        // Initialize the DP table with zeros
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        
        for (const string& s : strs) {
            int count0 = count(s.begin(), s.end(), '0');
            int count1 = s.size() - count0;
            
            // Update the DP table from bottom-right to top-left
            for (int i = m; i >= count0; --i) {
                for (int j = n; j >= count1; --j) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - count0][j - count1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
};
Explanation:
Counting 0s and 1s: For each string, we count the number of 0s and 1s.

DP Table Update: We iterate through the DP table from the bottom-right to the top-left to ensure that we do not overwrite values that are yet to be used in the current iteration.

Maximization: For each cell in the DP table, we decide whether to include the current string or not by comparing the current value with the value obtained by including the string.

Example Walkthrough:
For the input strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3:

The DP table is updated step by step, considering each string.

The final value dp[5][3] will be 4, which corresponds to the largest subset {"10", "0001", "1", "0"}.
