Approaches:
Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Use BFS to explore all possible strings by removing one parenthesis at a time.

At each level of BFS, remove one parenthesis and check if the resulting string is valid.

If a valid string is found at a level, stop further exploration since we are looking for the minimum number of removals.

Use a queue to implement BFS and a set to avoid duplicate strings.

Validation:

A string is valid if the number of opening and closing parentheses is balanced, and no closing parenthesis appears before its corresponding opening parenthesis.

Time Complexity:

In the worst case, the time complexity is 
O
(
2
n
)
O(2 
n
 ), where 
n
n is the number of parentheses. However, BFS ensures that we stop as soon as we find valid strings, making it efficient in practice.

Space Complexity:

The space complexity is 
O
(
2
n
)
O(2 
n
 ) due to the queue and set used for BFS.

Solution Code:
cpp
Copy
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeInvalidParentheses(string s) {
        vector<string> result;
        queue<string> q;
        unordered_set<string> visited;

        q.push(s);
        visited.insert(s);

        bool found = false; // Flag to stop further exploration once valid strings are found

        while (!q.empty()) {
            string current = q.front();
            q.pop();

            if (isValid(current)) {
                result.push_back(current);
                found = true;
            }

            if (found) {
                // If valid strings are found at this level, skip further removals
                continue;
            }

            // Try removing each parenthesis
            for (int i = 0; i < current.length(); i++) {
                if (current[i] != '(' && current[i] != ')') {
                    continue; // Skip non-parenthesis characters
                }

                string next = current.substr(0, i) + current.substr(i + 1);

                if (visited.find(next) == visited.end()) {
                    q.push(next);
                    visited.insert(next);
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

private:
    bool isValid(string s) {
        int balance = 0;

        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(') {
                balance++;
            } else if (c == ')') {
                balance--;
                if (balance < 0) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return balance == 0;
    }
};
Explanation:
BFS Initialization:

Start by adding the original string s to the queue and marking it as visited.

BFS Exploration:

Dequeue a string from the queue and check if it is valid using the isValid function.

If the string is valid, add it to the result and set the found flag to true.

If valid strings are found at the current level, skip further removals to ensure the minimum number of removals.

Removing Parentheses:

For each string, try removing one parenthesis at a time and add the new string to the queue if it hasn't been visited.

Validation:

The isValid function checks if the string has balanced parentheses by maintaining a balance counter.

Example Walkthrough:
Input:
cpp
Copy
s = "()())()"
Execution:
Start with s = "()())()".

Check if it is valid: No (extra closing parenthesis).

Remove one parenthesis at a time:

Remove ) at index 4: "()()()" → Valid → Add to result.

Remove ) at index 2: "()())()" → Invalid → Skip.

Remove ( at index 0: ")())()" → Invalid → Skip.

Remove ( at index 1: "())()" → Invalid → Skip.

Remove ) at index 3: "()()()" → Valid → Add to result.

Remove ( at index 5: "()())(" → Invalid → Skip.

Result: ["(())()", "()()()"].

Output:
cpp
Copy
["(())()", "()()()"]
Key Points:
BFS for Minimum Removals:

BFS ensures that we find valid strings with the minimum number of removals.

Avoiding Duplicates:

The visited set ensures that we do not process the same string multiple times.

Efficiency:

The solution is efficient for the given constraints (s.length <= 25 and at most 20 parentheses).

Output for Other Test Cases:
Input:
cpp
Copy
s = "(a)())()"
Output:
cpp
Copy
["(a())()", "(a)()()"]
Input:
cpp
Copy
s = ")("
Output:
cpp
Copy
[""]
This solution handles all edge cases and ensures that the minimum number of parentheses are removed to make the string valid.
