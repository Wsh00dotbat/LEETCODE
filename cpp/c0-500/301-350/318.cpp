To solve the problem of finding the maximum product of the lengths of two words that do not share any common letters, we can use a bitmasking approach. This approach allows us to efficiently check if two words share any common letters by representing each word's character set as a bitmask.

Steps:
Bitmask Representation: For each word, create a bitmask where each bit represents whether a specific letter is present in the word. For example, the word "abc" would have the bitmask 000...0111 (bits for a, b, and c are set).

Compare Words: Iterate through all pairs of words and check if their bitmasks have no overlapping bits (i.e., their bitwise AND is zero). If they don't share any common letters, calculate the product of their lengths and keep track of the maximum product.

Return Result: After checking all pairs, return the maximum product found.

Code Implementation:
cpp
Copy
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProduct(std::vector<std::string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();
        std::vector<int> bitmasks(n, 0); // Store bitmasks for each word

        // Step 1: Create bitmasks for each word
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (char c : words[i]) {
                bitmasks[i] |= (1 << (c - 'a')); // Set the bit for the character
            }
        }

        int maxProd = 0;

        // Step 2: Compare all pairs of words
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                // Check if the two words have no common letters
                if ((bitmasks[i] & bitmasks[j]) == 0) {
                    // Calculate the product of their lengths
                    int prod = words[i].length() * words[j].length();
                    maxProd = std::max(maxProd, prod); // Update the maximum product
                }
            }
        }

        return maxProd;
    }
};
Explanation:
Bitmask Creation:

For each word, we iterate through its characters and set the corresponding bit in the bitmask. For example, 'a' corresponds to bit 0, 'b' to bit 1, and so on.

The bitmask for "abc" would be 000...0111 (bits 0, 1, and 2 are set).

Comparison:

For each pair of words, we check if their bitmasks have no overlapping bits using the bitwise AND operation. If the result is zero, the words share no common letters.

If they don't share any letters, we calculate the product of their lengths and update the maximum product if this product is larger than the current maximum.

Result:

After checking all pairs, we return the maximum product found.

Example Walkthrough:
Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Bitmasks:

"abcw": 000...0111 (bits for a, b, c, w)

"baz": 000...0110 (bits for b, a, z)

"foo": 000...0100 (bits for f, o)

"bar": 000...0110 (bits for b, a, r)

"xtfn": 000...1100 (bits for x, t, f, n)

"abcdef": 000...0111 (bits for a, b, c, d, e, f)

Comparisons:

"abcw" and "xtfn" have no common letters (000...0111 & 000...1100 = 0), so their product is 4 * 4 = 16.

Other pairs either share common letters or have a smaller product.

Result: 16

Time Complexity:
O(n^2): We compare all pairs of words, and for each pair, the bitwise AND operation is O(1).

Space Complexity:
O(n): We store a bitmask for each word.

This approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints.
