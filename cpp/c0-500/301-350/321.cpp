To solve the problem of creating the maximum number of length k from two arrays nums1 and nums2 while preserving the relative order of digits from each array, we can break the problem into smaller subproblems:

Generate All Possible Subsequences:

For each possible way to split k into i and k - i (where i is the number of digits taken from nums1 and k - i is the number of digits taken from nums2), generate the maximum subsequence of length i from nums1 and the maximum subsequence of length k - i from nums2.

Merge Subsequences:

For each pair of subsequences generated in step 1, merge them to form the largest possible number of length k.

Select the Maximum Result:

Compare all merged results and select the one that forms the largest number.

Key Steps:
Max Subsequence:

Use a monotonic stack to generate the maximum subsequence of a given length from an array while preserving the relative order.

Merge Two Subsequences:

Merge two subsequences to form the largest possible number by always choosing the larger available digit from either subsequence.

Compare Results:

Compare all possible merged results to find the maximum one.

Explanation:
Max Subsequence:

The maxSubsequence function uses a monotonic stack to generate the largest subsequence of a given length while preserving the relative order of digits.

Merge Subsequences:

The merge function merges two subsequences by always choosing the larger available digit from either subsequence. This ensures the merged result is the largest possible.

Main Logic:

The maxNumber function iterates over all possible ways to split k into i and k - i, generates the corresponding subsequences, merges them, and keeps track of the largest result.

Example Walkthrough:
Input: nums1 = [3,4,6,5], nums2 = [9,1,2,5,8,3], k = 5
Possible splits:

i = 0: Take 0 digits from nums1 and 5 from nums2.

i = 1: Take 1 digit from nums1 and 4 from nums2.

i = 2: Take 2 digits from nums1 and 3 from nums2.

i = 3: Take 3 digits from nums1 and 2 from nums2.

i = 4: Take 4 digits from nums1 and 1 from nums2.

For each split:

Generate the maximum subsequences from nums1 and nums2.

Merge the subsequences and compare to find the largest result.

Result: [9,8,6,5,3]

Time Complexity:
O(k * (m + n)^2): The outer loop runs k times, and for each iteration, we generate subsequences and merge them, which takes 
O
(
m
+
n
)
O(m+n) time.

Space Complexity:
O(k): The space used for storing the result and intermediate subsequences.

This approach is efficient and works well within the given constraints.
